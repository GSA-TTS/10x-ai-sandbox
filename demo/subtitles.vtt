1
00:00:00.692 --> 00:00:01.132
Let's roll.

2
00:00:02.113 --> 00:00:03.575
Cool.

3
00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:06.998
So I wanted to give you all a quick update intro demo

4
00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:11.543
to this AI sandbox tool that you may have heard of.

5
00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:14.426
I'm going to walk through a few of the features.

6
00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.167
I'll start out by just saying.

7
00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:23.322
The principle behind this thing is to show you not that AI is great for everything,

8
00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:26.485
to try to encourage you to stick AI into every

9
00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:30.788
product that you might be ideating around, but rather to provide

10
00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:35.712
a simple way to interact with these tools and to quickly prototype.

11
00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:38.573
One of the interesting things and dangerous things about

12
00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:43.554
foundation models is that they are generically useful for text information tasks.

13
00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:47.695
And so you can simultaneously prototype quickly, but you

14
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.116
can also get yourself into trouble thinking that can do things that it can't.

15
00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:54.677
And so I wanted to set up an environment where people can poke at the guardrails,

16
00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:57.297
prototype things quickly, figure out if there's something

17
00:00:57.297 --> 00:01:00.658
there with respect to using this technology for your use case.

18
00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:03.879
So to that end, I'll kind of

19
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.860
go through the highlights here.

20
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.383
So the first thing you'll notice is it's similar to chatgpt.com.

21
00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.266
General idea is to try to be a superset of the feature offerings there.

22
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.648
We know that folks across government are shoving

23
00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:22.691
classified or not classified but sensitive unclassified data

24
00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:26.793
into chatgpt.com in violation of their policy every single day.

25
00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:32.017
So we're hoping that we can offer this to those folks in such a way that they'll never look back.

26
00:01:33.204 --> 00:01:35.825
So the first thing you'll notice that's different is that

27
00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:40.268
there's more models to choose from and that the models come from different providers, right?

28
00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:43.049
So we can access models from different vendors.

29
00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.391
We aren't sort of locked into a single vendor here.

30
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.212
The other thing you'll notice is that there are some

31
00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:51.154
custom models down here, which we'll get to in a moment.

32
00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:58.538
So yeah, so basically you can choose a model, you can do the normal stuff, pick a random prompt.

33
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.632
It behaves very similarly to chatgpd.com, but the interesting stuff kind of happens up here.

34
00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:12.054
So this is a kind of little workspace where you can do a little bit of prototyping.

35
00:02:12.054 --> 00:02:14.114
So the first thing I'll show you is the playground.

36
00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:20.036
For those that aren't familiar with what a system prompt is, basically it's instructions

37
00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.357
that you can give to a model to guide its

38
00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:28.919
behavior that operate differently from putting those instructions directly into the chat.

39
00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.920
So if you ask the model to do something directly in the chat, it's gonna like,

40
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.262
kind of pay attention to that, but if you put it

41
00:02:35.262 --> 00:02:37.104
in the system prompt, it's going to try really hard.

42
00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:39.766
So I'll give a kind of example here.

43
00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:46.992
We'll do something where we give some brief instructions.

44
00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:48.774
So we'll do this.

45
00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:50.155
Let me zoom in a little bit.

46
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.164
All right, so you are a plain language conversion assistant,

47
00:02:56.164 --> 00:02:59.566
convert what the user said into plain language, do not add anything else to your response, right?

48
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:09.013
Let's for a moment just delete that and then we'll give it a complex paragraph.

49
00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:14.097
I'm lifting this from the Wikipedia entry on electroencephalography.

50
00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:15.818
We'll hit submit and we'll see what it does, right?

51
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:23.233
Okay, so it looks like we're still using a lot

52
00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:29.096
of jargon here, you know, pyramidal neurons, allocortex, not sure everybody knows what that is.

53
00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:33.758
So we can, you know, tweak this system prompt, we

54
00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:37.300
can delete this response, we can tweak this system prompt, say

55
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:47.565
like, aim for a sixth grade reading level, either avoid jargon or

56
00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:52.809
Explain complex terms.

57
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:56.632
See if that improves it.

58
00:03:58.854 --> 00:04:03.597
Yeah, so no allocortex, no pyramidal neurons.

59
00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:04.718
We're getting better, right?

60
00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:07.480
So you can kind of sit here and work with these

61
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.304
system prompts to try to shift the guardrails, guide the behavior toward what you're looking for.

62
00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:15.306
The interesting thing about this

63
00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:20.008
Playground is that you can also mock up conversations.

64
00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:22.589
So an important thing to note about these text models

65
00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:27.430
is that they retain the previous messages each time they generate something.

66
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.432
And previous messages can affect what gets generated next.

67
00:04:32.432 --> 00:04:35.593
And so the interesting thing about the playground is that

68
00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:43.355
you can go back and edit historical messages for both the user and the assistant, right?

69
00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.056
So you can mock up an entire conversation and see what

70
00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:49.377
gets generated next in order to try and figure out if this

71
00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:52.458
thing is going to kind of escape your guardrails in a certain situation.

72
00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:54.158
So that can be helpful.

73
00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.339
I'll go over here.

74
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.042
So we can also upload documents to give the model a knowledge base.

75
00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:08.904
Sort of document retrieval and summarization is a kind of primary

76
00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:12.945
mode for a lot of AI use cases in government.

77
00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.446
So I'll show you how this works.

78
00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:18.387
You can upload some documents.

79
00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:20.448
I'm going to choose a couple of pardon forms.

80
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.611
from our forms platform effort, and I'm gonna give it a tag.

81
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:28.091
I'm gonna say pardon.

82
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:31.512
So I'm gonna do that.

83
00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:32.453
These get uploaded.

84
00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:35.793
And now we've got a tag here called pardon.

85
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:40.795
I can select it and I can see what documents are in my pardon collection.

86
00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:43.435
So I can go create a new chat.

87
00:05:43.435 --> 00:05:51.258
I can reference with the hashtag, the pardon collection, which will reference those two documents.

88
00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:52.078
And I'm gonna say,

89
00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:57.007
How do I qualify for a pardon?

90
00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:03.749
So we can see that these two documents have been referenced down here.

91
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:04.489
We can click on them.

92
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.070
We can see the citations.

93
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.071
So these are the actual chunks of the documents themselves

94
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.652
that have been referenced by the model in providing this answer.

95
00:06:15.112 --> 00:06:17.054
But one thing you'll notice is that it gives a

96
00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:22.880
generic response, right, for eligibility across two documents.

97
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.163
These two documents are two different kinds of pardons.

98
00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:28.245
One's simple marijuana, one's the presidential pardon,

99
00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.527
and they have different eligibility requirements.

100
00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:33.450
So this answer is not great, right?

101
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.391
So what can we do about that?

102
00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:36.763
So we can go here.

103
00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.223
We could go back to the playground.

104
00:06:38.223 --> 00:06:42.505
We could tune a system prompt to try to improve that, like

105
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:46.607
say, hey, make a note if you have two different documents, et cetera.

106
00:06:47.947 --> 00:06:51.309
And then what we can do is we can create a custom model.

107
00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.270
And so this, I'm going to call it Pardon Bot.

108
00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:58.189
We're gonna, you choose a base model.

109
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.771
So a custom model is really simple.

110
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:03.273
It's a base model, a system prompt, and a knowledge base.

111
00:07:03.273 --> 00:07:05.135
And the knowledge base is optional.

112
00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:09.338
So we're gonna give it a description, says things about pardons.

113
00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:16.523
I'm gonna grab a little system prompt that I wrote previously and paste it in here.

114
00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:20.306
But the kind of key piece of this is

115
00:07:22.897 --> 00:07:27.120
So basically talk about which document it comes from, talk

116
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.123
about which page it comes from, and we'll see if that improves the quality of the response.

117
00:07:31.123 --> 00:07:35.086
So I'm gonna select my pardon collection here, turn on

118
00:07:35.086 --> 00:07:39.530
vision, because I don't need it, save it, create a new chat,

119
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:45.174
grab my pardon bot, and I'm gonna ask it the same question.

120
00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:50.458
We'll see what happens.

121
00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:01.932
Okay, interestingly, it gave me the results for one specific

122
00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:05.396
kind of pardon, and it told me which specific kind of pardon.

123
00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:08.180
I would have preferred to hear about both delineated

124
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.063
nicely, but we're moving in the right direction, right?

125
00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:14.007
And that's ultimately what the sandbox is all about.
