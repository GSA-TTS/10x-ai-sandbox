# TODOs

- Integrate cloud SSO 
- Use postgres for db
- Build step during CI.
- Consider checking for state and code in front-end auth route and then redirecting to /auth (and clearing params) on any auth failures. This will allow us to avoid flashing the sign in screen before showing "signing into ai sandbox..." 
- Save and retrieve valves.json data from env instead of json
- Remove pipeline add from admin settings > pipelines
- Investigation RAG set up
