# TODOs

## Current Project TODOs

- Put up a warning banner on publicly shared links that says "This is a test for technology evaluation purposes only, this is not a decisional document" Make demo Videos: playground switching sys prompts, transfer sys prompt to custom model with docs
- Cite sources in rag (do this for other models, too):
- Allow bulk select even when nothing is tagged: <https://github.com/GSA-TTS/temp-10x-ai-sandbox/blob/66acbd1b866e9c93edc4457048af323c2fc0a5d0/src/lib/components/workspace/Documents.svelte#L280-L281>
- Models and docs need ownership and visibility in database, owner str, visibility [str]
- gray out vision for custom models that don't have vision
- Ability to share docs/models by pasting an email of another user ("This email is belongs to a sandbox user. They will now have access to the model" / "This email does not belong to a sandbox user"). Probably want comma separation...
- Add http links to Doc upload options, seems mostly done
- Fix tagging ux, add tags should be clickable, should save when you hit save
- Check and batch-tag multiple docs
- documents tab needs a spinner when processing docs
- existing tags should be selectable when adding to docs
- Need initial (Type a message down there ðŸ‘‡ to get started / explain that this is a chat interface) message for new users
- Soft outline around new chat and documents buttons
- Fix translations for docs & more and search your chats, as well as sign in screen
- create a couple default custom prompts shortcuts like /quick-summary ([type something here]) and /quick-summary-from-paste {{clipboard}}
- Unhide Tools from Docs & more layout
- Chroma is kept in ram... need to swap for redisVL
- tell run format to ignore package.json so we don't have to npm install in pre-commit to get formatting to match in the ci check
- change cors all origins to front end and pipelines only
