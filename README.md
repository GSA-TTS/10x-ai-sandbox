# 10x AI Sandbox

The **10x AI Sandbox** is an innovative project by **10x**, a venture studio in collaboration with the **General Services Administration (GSA)**. Its primary goal is to enable federal agencies to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI) in a secure, FedRAMP-compliant environment. By providing access to base models from leading AI companies and offering advanced UI features, the sandbox empowers agencies to test and validate new AI use cases efficiently

## Features

- **FedRAMP-Approved Access**: Secure access to AI base models from multiple leading providers.
- **Prompt Playground**: A user-friendly interface for tweaking and optimizing system prompts.
- **Document Upload & Management**: Upload documents, tag collections, and reference them in chat using the `#` character.
- **Custom Models**: Create custom AI models by combining different system prompts, base models, and knowledge bases (via document upload and collection tagging).
- **Efficient Testing**: Rapidly test AI product offerings against real-world government use cases.

## Mission

The 10x AI Sandbox is designed to help federal agencies quickly and cost-effectively:

1. Continuously test the latest AI market offerings against real-world government use cases in a secure environment.
2. Enable smart, modular technology procurement based on value proven through real-world use.
3. Quickly discover and clarify agency AI needs, potential value, and risks.
4. Enable use case owners to check assumptions early and often during use case development.

## How to get access

The project team is working on publishing an easy-to-consume containerized version of the app to the AWS and AWS GovCloud marketplaces, see #contributing below.

## Local Installation

Developers: detailed installation instructions are available in the [LOCALDEV.md](./LOCALDEV.md) file.

## Acknowledgments
